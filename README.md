Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux, Unix and Windows.
Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas
and information you deal with every day (a direct quote from Tomboy's Readme).

tomboy-ng is a shameless copy of the origional Tomboy but rewritten in Free Pascal
and Lazarus in an effort to deliver the usefullness of Tomboy but in a simpler
to install and easier to maintain package.

So far it supports much the same editing and formatting capabilities as Tomboy.
It works seemlessly with Tomboy's file sync and supports the same Notebook
model (and slightly extends it).

And it works, out of the box, no extra libraries needed, on Linux (GTK), Windows
and Mac. In most cases, all you really need is the 3Mbyte to 4Mbyte binary.
