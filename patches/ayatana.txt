Ayatana Patch

For GTK2

Adds the ayatana appindicator to the list that UnityWSCtrl tries to use
to provide a SysTray Icon on Gnome.  Currently only required on Debian.

Apply from the top of the lazarus (trunk) tree, where you see the lcl directory.

$> patch -p0 < ayatana.patch

All of the Gnome Desktop using Linuxes also require 
gnome-shell-extension-appindicator (restart desktop) and then enable.


Not needed after r65119, 21/5/2021
