This patch forces all Ubuntu Gnome systems to use LibAppIndicator3
instead of the default old System Tray.

Has been tested back to U16.04 to U19.10. Has no effect on systems
other than Ubuntu Gnome. Will prevent TrayIcon OnClick events on
older systems that still work with the old System Tray model, sorry
tomboy-ng does not rely on such behaviour, its menu only from
TrayIcon.

It needs to be applied to Fixes branch prior to release of 2.0.6
and probably aftwards for a while.

It will probably need to be applied to 2.0.6 as it was too late to
make the cut.
