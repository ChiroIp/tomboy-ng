This patch builds on previous appindicator patch.
It now forces LCL to use the libappindicator_3 if its available. Even
if libappindicator_1 is present. It seem that at least U19.04 cannot
use libappindicator_1 (maybe its only present because of a OS upgrade?).

To apply, cd to YourLazDir/lcl/interfaces/gtk2 and type 
patch < PATH_TO_Patchfile/use_AppInd_3.patch
