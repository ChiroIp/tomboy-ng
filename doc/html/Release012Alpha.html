This release represents a lot of bug fixing, a lot of work on stability and <b>Support for Tomboy Notebooks</b> including an option to allow a particular note to be a member of more than one Notebook. That option is risky if used with an existing Tomboy and untested with tomdroid.

Copy &amp; Paste is now reliable and even uses the Mac's funny Command key.

It also features, if that's the word, some changes that minimise the memory leak on the Mac (yes, it's still there to some extent). The cost is that the list of recently used notes directly under the tray menu is not updated as often as you might expect, only when a new note enters the game. This is a Mac-only issue !

<b>Linux</b> The gz files will work on many Linux systems that have gtk available. The deb files include some icon and desktop files so are preferable for Debian, Ubuntu etc.

<b>Windows</b> users should download either the Win32 or Win64 zip files. No installer yet, just unzip and copy the single binary somewhere. Your desktop would be fine. You will need to reassure Windows that the binary is safe. I hope it is.

<b>Mac</b> users should download the dmg file, double click it and drag the (generic) icon into the Application icon. You can then close that window, unmount the install kit and even delete the dmg file if you like. Sorry about the icon, I'll try harder if you indicate the app is useful to you.</div></body></html>
