Much thanks due to the authors and developers of the above. Thanks are also due to the many people involved with the FPC/Lazarus Forum without who's help and patience this project would not have every got off the ground.

The user interface and design of Tomboy, indeed, the very idea, is a product of the origional Tomboy authors, see - https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tomboy
