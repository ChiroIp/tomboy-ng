This is Davos ill fated attempt to authenticate over AOuth

It targets a local nextcloud install with grauphel installed, I could not 
install grauphel on the one free NextCloud Provider accounts I tried.

I suspect there are issues with the LCL POST sending content in the header 
rather than the body ??

grauphel reports that the transaction requesting a non authorised Token has 
a bad password. See comments in the OAuth unit.

Then I permently crashed my VM and lost interest......
