### Heading, bold and Large

## Heading, bold and huge



Some text, *this phrase in italics* and this is not. But **this phrase is in bold**, and that really stands out, so does highlight.



**this is the first line of a multi para bold bit.**

**And this is the second para, all bold up until here,** after that its not bold.



***this is bold and italics but** bold stopped early.*

This is nothing ....

***this is italics and bold but*** **the italics stopped early.**



***Bold, Italics and highlight and small***



Just to be carful, we must ensure angle brackets such as &lt; and &gt; are preserved.
